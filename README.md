### Hi there 👋

I have a mixed background in STEM with a Bachelor's dergree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Maryland 🐢, and a Master's degree in Statistics from University of Berkeley 🐻. I got my start in Data Science as a conusltant doing process improvement for the Department of Veteran Affairs, and I've been doing Machine Learning consulting in some form or fashion for the past 10+ years, most recently with Amazon Web Services Professional Services. During this time I've worked on a wide variety of projects:

* 🏭 Industrial and Manufacturing Computer Vision.
* 🔍 Document summarization and processing using Natural Language Processing.
* 🤖 Human in the loop chat bot development using Deep Learning.
* 🚚 Routing optimization using Deep Reinforcement Learning.
* 🏒 Sports analytics and prediction.
* 📈 Electricity and gas consumption forecasting.
* 💻 Machine learning application development using Amazon Web Services.


Recently, I left the consulting world, and took on a new focus in Amazon's [Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncwsr1Of6Cw) organization. In my new role I work on appliyng machine learning and reinforcement learning to the core selection process. My job is to figure out what customer's want in stock, and for Amazon to have it.

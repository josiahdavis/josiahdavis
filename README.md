### Hi there 👋

I have a mixed background in STEM with a Bachelor's dergree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Maryland, and a Master's degree in Statistics from University of Berkeley. I got my start in Data Science as a conusltant doing process improvement for the Department of Veteran Affairs, and I've been doing consulting in some form or fashion for the psat 10+ years. During this time I've worked on a wide variety of projects:

* Industrial and Manufacturing Computer Vision.
* Document summarization and processing using Natural Language Processing.
* Human in the loop chat bot development.
* Routing optimization using Deep Reinforcement Learning.
* Electricity and gas consumption forecasting.

Additionally, I have a lot of experience working on Machine Learning application development on Amazon Web Services.

Recently, I left the consulting world, and took on a new focus in Amazon's Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT) organization. In my new role I work on appliyng machine learning and reinforcement learning to the core selection process. My job is to figure out what customer's want in stock, and for Amazon to have it.

## Bio

I have a mixed background in STEM with a Bachelor's dergree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Maryland 🐢, and a Master's degree in Statistics from University of Berkeley 🐻. I got my start in Data Science as a conusltant doing process improvement for the Department of Veteran Affairs, and I've been doing Machine Learning consulting in some form or fashion for the past 10+ years, most recently with [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9__D53WsUs) Professional Services. During this time I've worked on a wide variety of projects:

* 🏭 Industrial and Manufacturing Computer Vision.
* 🔍 Document summarization and processing using Natural Language Processing.
* 🤖 Human in the loop chat bot development using Deep Learning.
* 🚚 Routing optimization using Deep Reinforcement Learning ([code](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-tsp-deep-rl)).
* 🏒 Sports analytics and prediction ([2021](https://www.sportsvideo.org/2021/10/25/nhl-deploys-analytics-powered-graphics-for-puck-player-tracking-in-live-broadcast/), [2022](https://apnews.com/article/nhl-technology-sports-hockey-1cd9ab11ed1c5311ec853e11dd58c107)).
* 📈 Electricity and gas consumption forecasting.
* 💻 Machine learning application development using Amazon Web Services ([code](https://github.com/awslabs/mlmax/)).


Recently, I left the consulting world, and took on a new focus in Amazon's [Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncwsr1Of6Cw) organization. In my new role I work on appliyng machine learning and reinforcement learning to the core selection process. My job is to figure out what customer's want in stock, and for Amazon to have it.
